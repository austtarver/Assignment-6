# Assignment-6
 For this assignment I familiarized myself with the NavMesh and its different applications.
 
 For Scene 1 I added obstacles from the nature pack, lowman from standard assets, and target cubes that could be picked up by the player. I also kept track of cubes picked up.
 
 For Scene 2 I added obstacles and a lowman similar to scene 1, but I made the obstacles move on the plane, making them dynamic. I also added cubes to pick up along with a score tracker.
 
 For Scene 3 I added more outside obstacles and a lowman, but this time the obstacles spawn in on runtime instead of being pre set. I also added a score tracker.
 
 For Scene 4 I added a link between 2 planes that the player could cross, I also had a boulder chase the player, destroying him on contact. There is also a text box that pops up letting you know you lost.
 
 For Scene 5 I did the same thing I did in scene 1, but instead of lowman, I used the modern seceretary model and animations.
